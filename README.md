## Running

You can find a running version hosted on Gigalixir [`here`](https://personality-test.gigalixirapp.com/)

If you want to run this locally, you need to have an Elixir/Phoenix environment set up.

You can use the official guide to install Elixir and the Phoenix framework by following the instructions on the [official Phoenix website](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html).
